The largest data on Buccal Mucosa cancers is from India to the best of our knowledge.   \n2. About $70 \\%$ of the patients with this cancer are locally advanced at the time of presentation.   \n3. More and more patients are diagnosed at relatively younger age and these patients may have a different biologic disease as compared to older patients.   \n4. The treatment options considered for these locally advanced Buccal Mucosa tumors are surgery in combination with radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone. The role of concurrent chemoradiotherapy or post operative chemoradiotherapy specifically for the subset of patients with Buccal Mucosa cancer have not been studied in randomized trials. The data available from studies in head and neck cancers in general show that combined modality treatment i.e. concurrent chemoradiotherapy is better than radiotherapy alone, both in the definitive and adjuvant settings [MACH-NC meta-analysis31-33]   \n5. Thirty to forty percent of patients with T2N0M0 disease relapse after single modality treatment (especially patients with T2 and tumor thickness more than $4 \\mathrm { m m }$ ). This was evident in three large series from India incorporating more than 700 patients (Mishra et al, Pradhan et al, and Dinshaw et al) and from China and Australia. The exact reasons for this is yet unclear and requires randomized studies to identify patients with early stage high risk features who may benefit from multi modality treatment approaches. In the absence of such randomized adequately powered studies, the best currently available data is from case series reported till now. They indicate that adjuvant treatment in such cases can improve outcomes.   \n6. Prognostic factors in patients with Buccal Mucosa cancer need further studies. Data from India highlight the importance of tumor thickness in the outcome of these tumors. Data from other sub sites in head and neck cancers suggest that tumor thickness, extra capsular spread, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, nodal metastases, surgical margins, grade of tumor differentiation are some of the prognostic markers to predict relapse.   \n7. There are few studies on induction chemotherapy or concurrent chemotherapy from India in randomized settings in head and neck cancer patients including Buccal Mucosa cancer and one large retrospective study34-37.   \n8. There is limited data on palliative chemotherapy or radiotherapy, in advanced disease38-40.   \n9. Role of concurrent chemoradiation in Buccal Mucosa cancers is not defined. This has been shown to be an acceptable alternative to surgery and RT in T3-T4 head & neck lesions32. Given the fact that Buccal Mucosa cancers represent a relatively more aggressive subsite, addition of chemoradiation in adjuvant setting has the potential to be beneficial. This would be an area for further clinical research.   \n10. There is no category I evidence for induction chemotherapy in operable cancers. This approach may be considered in borderline operable tumors to enhance respectability41-42.   \n11. In the metastatic setting, treatment decision should be based on patient\u2019s symptoms and performance status. Systemic dissemination at presentation is a rarity for Buccal Mucosal cancers. If the patient has an asymptomatic metastatic deposit and/or advanced symptomatic locoregional disease, palliative radiotherapy or systemic chemotherapy are the two options for palliation. In the event of symptomatic systemic disease/ progressive disease after RT, chemotherapy (multiagent or single agent) should be considered.   \n12. Newer molecular agents: EGFR receptor antagonists are available in India. Cetuximab $^ +$ Cisplatin+   \n5FU has been shown to be superior to Cisplatin $^ +$ 5FU with benefit in survival for recurrent / metastatic head & neck cancer. The applicability of these results in Buccal Mucosa cancers in India requires validation43-46.   \n13. An effective chemoprevention agent is not available.   \n14. Screening for early detection for high risk patients have been reported to decrease mortality.

This surgery should be undertaken only in centres with facilities and expertise for this surgery available and only by teams who have the experience and commitment to look after the long-term rehabilitation of these patients. The prognosis is better for patients with a disease-free interval greater than six months, a recurrence $3 \\mathrm { c m }$ or less in diameter, and no sidewall fixation. The five-year survival for patients selected for treatment with pelvic exenteration is in the order of $3 0 \\mathrm { ~ - ~ } 6 0 \\%$ and the operative mortality should be $< 1 0 \\%$ . In carefully selected patients, a radical hysterectomy may be performed. Suitable patients are mainly those whose central tumour is not more than $2 \\mathrm { c m }$ in diameter. Grade C Recommendations.", "1. The largest data on Buccal Mucosa cancers is from India to the best of our knowledge.   \n2. About $70 \\%$ of the patients with this cancer are locally advanced at the time of presentation.   \n3. More and more patients are diagnosed at relatively younger age and these patients may have a different biologic disease as compared to older patients.   \n4. The treatment options considered for these locally advanced Buccal Mucosa tumors are surgery in combination with radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone. The role of concurrent chemoradiotherapy or post operative chemoradiotherapy specifically for the subset of patients with Buccal Mucosa cancer have not been studied in randomized trials. The data available from studies in head and neck cancers in general show that combined modality treatment i.e. concurrent chemoradiotherapy is better than radiotherapy alone, both in the definitive and adjuvant settings [MACH-NC meta-analysis31-33]   \n5. Thirty to forty percent of patients with T2N0M0 disease relapse after single modality treatment (especially patients with T2 and tumor thickness more than $4 \\mathrm { m m }$ ). This was evident in three large series from India incorporating more than 700 patients (Mishra et al, Pradhan et al, and Dinshaw et al) and from China and Australia. The exact reasons for this is yet unclear and requires randomized studies to identify patients with early stage high risk features who may benefit from multi modality treatment approaches. In the absence of such randomized adequately powered studies, the best currently available data is from case series reported till now. They indicate that adjuvant treatment in such cases can improve outcomes.   \n6. Prognostic factors in patients with Buccal Mucosa cancer need further studies. Data from India highlight the importance of tumor thickness in the outcome of these tumors. Data from other sub sites in head and neck cancers suggest that tumor thickness, extra capsular spread, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, nodal metastases, surgical margins, grade of tumor differentiation are some of the prognostic markers to predict relapse.   \n7. There are few studies on induction chemotherapy or concurrent chemotherapy from India in randomized settings in head and neck cancer patients including Buccal Mucosa cancer and one large retrospective study34-37.   \n8. There is limited data on palliative chemotherapy or radiotherapy, in advanced disease38-40.   \n9. Role of concurrent chemoradiation in Buccal Mucosa cancers is not defined. This has been shown to be an acceptable alternative to surgery and RT in T3-T4 head & neck lesions32. Given the fact that Buccal Mucosa cancers represent a relatively more aggressive subsite, addition of chemoradiation in adjuvant setting has the potential to be beneficial. This would be an area for further clinical research.   \n10. There is no category I evidence for induction chemotherapy in operable cancers. This approach may be considered in borderline operable tumors to enhance respectability41-42.   \n11. In the metastatic setting, treatment decision should be based on patient\u2019s symptoms and performance status. Systemic dissemination at presentation is a rarity for Buccal Mucosal cancers. If the patient has an asymptomatic metastatic deposit and/or advanced symptomatic locoregional disease, palliative radiotherapy or systemic chemotherapy are the two options for palliation. In the event of symptomatic systemic disease/ progressive disease after RT, chemotherapy (multiagent or single agent) should be considered.   \n12. Newer molecular agents: EGFR receptor antagonists are available in India. Cetuximab $^ +$ Cisplatin+   \n5FU has been shown to be superior to Cisplatin $^ +$ 5FU with benefit in survival for recurrent / metastatic head & neck cancer. The applicability of these results in Buccal Mucosa cancers in India requires validation43-46.   \n13. An effective chemoprevention agent is not available.   \n14. Screening for early detection for high risk patients have been reported to decrease mortality. Efforts to increase public awareness and effective screening procedures by integration into the health care delivery systems would go a long way towards effectively controlling this cancer.   \n15. Several areas of clinical and basic research still remain to be conducted before all questions regarding the optimum treatment of this cancer can be answered. India having the largest patient population with this cancer needs to conduct well organized randomized trials addressing key areas of research.", "The cancer of uterine cervix is the commonest cancer among the women in India. However, the incidence is gradually reducing especially in urban areas as observed in the population based registries. The treatment of early stage cancer cervix is either radical surgery or radical radiotherapy with similar results, whereas, for advanced stages the treatment remains as chemo-radiation. There has been several advances and refinement in the treatment modalities for treatment of cancer cervix in past few years."]}

Consider extended adjuvant therapy with letrozole after 5 years of tamoxifen in node positive postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen for 5 years is an acceptable alternative in post-menopausal women36,37.", "Breast cancer being the most common female cancer in the west, has been the subject of a large number of biological, pathology and therapeutic studies including numerous randomized trials and meta-analysis, examining in detail almost all aspects of disease management. However as most breast cancer patients in the west are now diagnosed with early stage or screen detected cancers, relatively fewer modern studies have focused on locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). While there is level I evidence for the safety and efficacy of breast conservative treatment (BCT) for operable breast cancer, high quality evidence does not exist for this approach in LABC. While there is a general consensus regarding the use of neo-adjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced or node positive breast cancer, there is lack of consensus among Indian oncologists for its use in small node negative cancers. We still have wide discrepancy across the country in terms of the availability and the quality of breast imaging; breast pathology including IHC and FISH; breast conserving surgery and axillary surgery; Linac based and cardiac sparing RT; and supportive care for complications of chemotherapy. As a result all eligible women are not offered BCT, many centres routinely give axillary RT in node positive cancers due to inadequate axillary surgery or its pathology reporting; radiotherapy (RT) practices are not standardized; and maintaining dose intensity and optimal scheduling of chemotherapy with surgery and RT and timely management of acute toxicity remains challenging. Only a fraction of women with breast cancer in India receive comprehensive multimodality treatment under one roof and under the expert guidance of a multidisciplinary team. Hence it is not always possible to directly apply some of the treatment approaches for which the trials in the west have shown clinical benefit. A panel of experts which included Radiation, Surgical and Medical oncologists, radiologists, pathologists and palliative care specialists have drafted this consensus and its applicability in the Indian setting. There is a need to have multi-disciplinary teams for evidence based management for all breast cancer patients. Provision of palliative care and availability of morphine is also an integral part of managing metastatic cancer.", "\u2022 Premenopausal\u2013Tamoxifen.

The recommended dose is cisplatin $3 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g / m ^ { 2 } }$ weekly. Minimum cumulative dose needs to be $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m g / m ^ { 2 } }$ . Alternately cisplatin at a dose of $1 0 0 \\mathrm { \\ m g / m ^ { 2 } }$ every three weekly during the course of radiotherapy is given (ideally chemotherapy is to be administered on days 1, 22 & 43 of radiotherapy).

In patients who are not candidates for cisplatin, carboplatin and paclitaxel is the regime of choice for chemoradiation.   \n4. Monoclonal antibody therapy directed against EGFR (cetuximab and nimotuzumab) added to radiation therapy improves outcome, however, there is no evidence in the Indian literature and cost benefit ratio may be considered before taking a decision.   \n5. Feeding through nasogastric tube, gastrostomy or jejunostomy is strongly recommended during chemoradiation.   \n6. If there is poor tolerance to the planned concurrent chemoradiation programme, chemotherapy should be withheld while radiotherapy is continued to the specified dose.", "\u2022 Choice of chemotherapy: \u2022 Combination regimens have generally been shown to improve response rates (RR) and progression-free survival (PFS) but not overall survival (OS) compared to single agent cisplatin17. Most commonly used regimen is paclitaxel and either cisplatin or carboplatin18. Although there is no randomized phase III evidence for carboplatin, there are several retrospective analyses and prospective non-randomized studies that indicate equivalent efficacy19,20. Therefore it is preferred over cisplatin (for which there is a randomized phase III trial18 because of ease of administration and better tolerability with respect to emesis, renal toxicity, ototoxicity, etc. Grade B recommendation \u2022 Another regimen that has been tested in a randomized phase III trial is topotecan plus cisplatin that was shown to be superior to single agent cisplatin with respect to RR, PFS and $\\mathrm { O S ^ { 2 1 } }$ . However it is not the preferred standard because of its unfavorable toxicity profile, including myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity. A recent phase III trial compared 4 platinum doublets (cisplatin $^ +$ either of the following: paclitaxel, topotecan, gemcitabine and vinorelbine ). There were no statistically significant differences in OS but there was a trend to superiority of cisplatin-paclitaxel in RR, PFS and $\\mathrm { O S ^ { 2 2 } }$ . Grade B recommendation \u2022 Other agents uncommonly used as second line palliative chemotherapy include vinorelbine, bevacizumab, irinotecan, ifosfamide and 5-FU. \u2022 To summarize the choice of palliative chemotherapy regimens: Paclitaxel plus carboplatin or single agent cisplatin. \u2022 In patients in whom peripheral neuropathy is a concern, gemcitabine-platinum is an acceptable alternative. Carboplatin is substituted for cisplatin in many regimens by most clinicians. Generally 4-6 cycles of chemotherapy are used.   \n\u2022 Response evaluation: Patients on palliative chemotherapy should be evaluated for disease response clinically (including symptomatic benefit) and radiologically as appropriate after every few cycles of chemotherapy.   \n\u2022 Patients not suitable for palliative radiotherapy or chemotherapy, symptomatic and supportive care should be offered. Patients should also be referred to a palliative care team, if accessible, early in the course of metastatic disease. Counseling and symptom control are some of the important components of palliative care for these patients.   \n\u2022 Relapse in the pelvis following primary surgery may be treated by radical radiation therapy with concomitant chemotherapy.   \n\u2022 Radical irradiation (with concurrent chemotherapy) may cure a substantial proportion of those with isolated pelvic failure after primary surgery depending on the extent of disease. Radiotherapy is usually a combination of external beam pelvic radiation and appropriate intracavitary/ interstitial or combination brachytherapy (Low dose rate/ High Dose rate / Pulse dose rate) depending on the available expertise. However, referral for interstitial brachytherapy to appropriate centers with expertise and experience is encouraged wherever feasible.   \n\u2022 Radiation treatment planning and dose prescription should be similar to locally advanced cervical cancer protocols. Patient not suitable for brachytherapy after external beam radiation, further external radiation boost with small fields up to a dose of 64 \u2013 66 Gy.   \nFor Post RT central recurrence, pelvic exenteration (particularly if a fistula is present) in selected patients without pelvic sidewall involvement may be offered.   \n\u2022 This surgery should be undertaken only in centres with facilities and expertise and only by teams who have the experience and commitment towards management of post-operative short and longterm rehabilitation of these patients.   \n\u2022 Palliative Chemotherapy has limited efficacy in pelvic recurrences that have been heavily irradiated earlier. It should only be used in highly selected patients with this presentation on an individualized basis. Grade C Recommendation   \n\u2022 The choice of chemotherapy schedules and frequency is similar as detailed in treatment of FIGO IV B section.", "There is general consensus in Indian oncologists regarding the use of surgery, with breast conservation when feasible and the indication for radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy in various stages of breast cancer. Breast conservation rates are low even for stage I & II breast cancers in most Indian centres and reflects the lack of access to modern radiotherapy. The quality of mastectomy, axillary lymph node dissection and pathology reporting varies significantly across the country. The choice of chemotherapy regimen and hormonal agents for different stages of breast cancer is determined not only by the prognostic and predictive factors but also by the logistics and access. Similarly the treatment for recurrent or metastatic disease is not uniform and is governed by several factors including the previous treatment, patient\u2019s ability to tolerate additional treatment and access to such treatment. For Indian women with operable breast cancer who received standard multimodal treatment in the control arm of a recently published large randomized clinical trial from Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), the 5 year disease free survival (DFS) rate of $70 \\%$ and overall survival rate of $78 \\%$ was reported2 ."]}

Supra omohyoid neck dissection in high risk patients with Buccal Mucosa cancers may be considered the surgery of choice and can save patients from facing morbidity associated with radical neck dissection.", "Several international consensus guidelines are available for the management of oral cavity cancers, but none them addresses Buccal Mucosa cancers in particular. Therefore, formulating reliable guidelines based on western data is questionable given the fact that Buccal Mucosa tumors are quite rare in the developed countries. A recent publication from Australia is based on the report of only 32 cases of Buccal Mucosa cancer6 . There is obviously an urgent need to formulate consensus statement for the management of carcinoma of Buccal Mucosa based on Indian data and experience which would not only incorporate the evidence available but would also be feasible to be practiced in the hospitals of India. The following part of this chapter provides some of the existing National and International guidelines for oral cavity cancer and reviews the applicability of the given guidelines for patients with carcinoma of Buccal Mucosa, especially in Indian context. A short review of the National and International data on Buccal Mucosa cancer is provided. The proposed national consensus document for Buccal Mucosa cancer is presented. Some of the key areas of research relevant to our country have also been mentioned.", "One of the largest reported series on outcome in Buccal Mucosa cancer is from the M.D. Anderson Cancer Hospital, Texas, $\\mathrm { U S A } ^ { 1 8 }$ reporting on 119 patients with invasive Buccal Mucosa cancer. All patients were surgically treated. None of them received definitive radiation. In patients with early stage disease, the relapse rate was up to $45 \\%$ . In view of high relapse rate in patients with N0 disease, authors suggested some form of adjuvant treatment in all patients with early disease and high risk tumors. They concluded that Buccal Mucosa cancer is a different disease biologically as compared to the rest of head and neck cancers and requires aggressive treatment. Lee et al reported treatment outcome of 32 patients of Buccal Mucosa cancer over $1 0 \\ y e a r s ^ { 6 }$ . Though a small series, the authors report $50 \\%$ relapse rate in spite of post operative radiation. They concluded that Buccal Mucosa sub site is an aggressive form of oral cavity cancer and multimodality treatment should be offered to as many as possible.", "Carcinoma of Head and Neck accounts for around $30 \\%$ of all cancers in male as per the recent consolidated report of the Hospital Based Cancer Registry (2009-2011) of National Cancer Registry program (NCRP). Carcinoma of mouth (excepting tongue) is the leading site of cancer in males in Mumbai and within the five leading sites in all registries in both the males and females except males and females in Chandigarh and in females in Dibrugarh. Carcinoma of Buccal mucosa is relatively uncommon in developed world but common in India owning to extensive use of tobacco in various forms particularly chewable tobacco. Majority of the patient $( 7 0 - 8 0 \\% )$ present in fairly advanced stage and the nature of presentation, site (for example gigivo-buccal sulcus), biological behavior and treatment also is different. There is lack of consensus over management of buccal mucosa cancers including role of concurrent chemo-radiation, induction chemotherapy, palliative chemotherapy etc. particularly in context of Indian sub-continent. The consensus evidence (NCCN, ESMO) for this sub-site of cancer is mainly based on experience in western countries. Cancer treatment facilities as well as diagnostic modalities are not available at all the places in India and the guidelines may not be applicable to all cancer centers. Need of consensus document for the management of buccal mucosa cancers has been strongly felt. A panel of experts which included radiation oncologist, onco-surgeons, and medical oncologist together drafted this consensus document (by incorporating relevant literature till December 2012) which covers the published evidence, diagnostic modalities, staging and treatment of buccal mucosa cancer in Indian setting. Basic principles of surgery, chemotherapy as well as radiotherapy are discussed and future research issues have also been highlighted.", "<html><body><table><tr><td>Author</td><td>Study subjects</td><td>Results</td><td>Comments</td></tr><tr><td>Fang FM et al 199750</td><td>Combined modality treatment for SCC&#x27; Buccal Mucosa. 57 patients study from Taiwan.</td><td>3 year DFS &amp; OS: 62% &amp; 55%.
